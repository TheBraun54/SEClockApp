# MuClock
MuClock is a .NET MAUI application that aims to add an entertaining twist to a mundane task: setting timers. While this functionality is built into many of the smart phones that we have today, we add a worthwhile twist of generating a playlist with a length that's equal to the user's desired timer length.

# Personalization in Music
Allow users to provide Spotify credentials to have the playlist be generated with music that the user enjoys listening to.

# Personalization in Theme
With the various themes that are available in our application, users will be able to choose the appearance of the app to fit best into what they desire!

# Installation
